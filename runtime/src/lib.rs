//! ducklink-runtime — the reusable wasm-component-loading engine.
//!
//! This crate is being extracted from `ducklink-host` so the same engine that
//! loads `duckdb:extension` wasm components can back two directions:
//!   1. the `ducklink` host, which runs DuckDB-compiled-to-wasm, and
//!   2. the native-DuckDB `ducklink` community extension (embeds wasmtime).
//!
//! Increment 1: the callback registry — maps a DuckDB-side function invocation
//! (by opaque handle) back to the owning wasm extension and its dispatcher.
//!
//! Increment 2: the `duckdb:extension` wasmtime bindings. The WIT world and its
//! generated host/guest types live here so both directions instantiate the same
//! component ABI; the host implements the `Host*` traits against its own store.
//!
//! Increment 4: the extension store-state + loaded-component instance (see the
//! [`extension`] module). The store-state implements the capability `Host*`
//! traits (capturing registrations into [`reg`]) and services config/logging
//! through an [`extension::ExtensionServices`] sink — the one direction-specific
//! seam.
